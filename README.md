# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Overview

The **Tic-Tac-Toe** project is part of the [JavaScript course on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe). This project demonstrates key JavaScript concepts such as module patterns, factory functions, and DOM manipulation. It allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe in the browser, complete with a user-friendly interface and game logic.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game**: Play Tic-Tac-Toe with a second player locally.
- **Interactive Grid**: Click on any cell to make a move, and the game will update the grid.
- **Winner Detection**: The app automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a draw.
- **Restart Option**: Reset the game to start a new round.

## Project Details

This project was built using:

- **HTML** for structuring the game board.
- **CSS** for styling and layout.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity.

The game logic is implemented using JavaScript factory functions, and the game state is managed through modules. No persistent data storage is implemented in this version.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser.



## Usage

1. Start the game by clicking on any cell in the grid.


2. Alternate between Player 1 and Player 2 until one wins or the game results in a draw.


3. Use the "Restart" button to play again.



## Future Enhancements

- Add AI for single-player mode.

- Implement a score tracker for multiple rounds.

- Add animations for moves and win/draw detection.
